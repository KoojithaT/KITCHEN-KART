# Kitchen Kart - Design Process

## 1. Research & Inspiration
We began by analyzing popular recipe apps and platforms such as Tasty, AllRecipes, and Yummly. User feedback and personal experiences were used to identify gaps, especially in terms of simplicity, image-first interfaces, and customizable filters.

## 2. User Persona Creation
To guide our UI/UX decisions, we created fictional user personas:
- **Ananya, 21:** A college student who wants quick vegetarian recipes.
- **Ravi, 35:** A working professional who wants to cook dinner with limited ingredients.
- **Sarah, 28:** A food blogger looking for unique international dishes.

## 3. Wireframing
Initial wireframes were sketched out to visualize:
- Home Page with search and featured recipes
- Recipe Detail Page with images, steps, and ingredients
- Category filters and bookmark management
Wireframes were created using Figma for clarity and iteration.

## 4. UI/UX Design
- We followed a **minimalistic and visual-first approach** with large images, clean typography, and color-coded categories.
- Used soft colors (green for veg, red for non-veg, yellow for breakfast, etc.) to guide users easily.
- The app follows a **card-based layout** for intuitive navigation.
- Mobile-first design ensured smooth responsiveness across devices.

## 5. Development
- Frontend was developed using ReactJS with reusable components for cards, buttons, and recipe modals.
- Recipe data was stored either in a local JSON or through a backend API (Firebase/Node.js).
- Routing was managed using React Router for navigation between pages.

## 6. Testing
- Conducted manual testing for:
  - Navigation flow
  - Responsiveness
  - Search and filter functionality
  - User interaction elements like buttons and bookmarks
- Feedback was collected from peers and used to refine UI elements.

## 7. Deployment
- The app was deployed using GitHub Pages / Netlify / Vercel for easy sharing.
